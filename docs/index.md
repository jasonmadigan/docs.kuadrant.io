# Overview

Kuadrant brings together [Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/) and [Open Cluster Management](https://open-cluster-management.io/) to help you scale, load-balance and secure your Ingress Gateways as a key part of your application connectivity, in the single or multi-cluster environment.

# Getting Started
To quickly get started with Kuadrant locally, see our **Getting Started** guides for the [Single Cluster](getting-started-single-cluster.md) or [Multi Cluster](getting-started-multi-cluster.md) use cases.

## Single-cluster

Kuadrant can be used to protect ingress gateways based on [Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/)[^1] with policy enforcement (rate limit and auth) in a Kuberentes cluster.

## Multi-cluster

In the multi-cluster environment[^2], you can utilize Kuadrant to manage DNS-based north-south connectivity, which can provide global load balancing underpinned by your cluster topology. Kuadrant's multi-cluster functionality also ensures gateway and policy consistency across clusters, focusing on critical aspects like TLS and application health.
